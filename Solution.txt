3. Delivery (Exploit Deployment)
Task: Deliver the exploit to the target.

4. Exploitation (Gaining Access)
Task: Execute the exploit and gain a foothold.
Include a Progress check1.py --> root permissions

5. Installation (Persistence)
Task: Establish persistence on the webserver.
create a persistent script.py

Hints:

Add a cron job or backdoor user.

Flag: FLAG2: PERSISTENCE_SET in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.

6. Command & Control (Lateral Movement)
Task: Pivot to the internal network (10.9.8.0/24) and access the Design or Engineering team hosts.

Hints:

Use the webserver as a pivot (e.g., sshuttle or chisel).

Discover credentials or misconfigurations (e.g., weak SSH passwords in /var/lib/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml).

Flag on Client 1 (Design Team): FLAG3: DESIGN_SECRETS in C:\Design\blueprints.zip.

7. Actions on Objectives (Exfiltration)
Task: Exfiltrate sensitive data.

Hints:

Use scp or HTTP POST to send data to the attacker's machine.

Final flag: FLAG4: KILL_CHAIN_COMPLETE in C:\Engineering\passwords.txt.

Additional Enhancements:
Misconfigurations:

Allow players to discover SSH credentials (e.g., tomcat:admin123) in a backup file.

Network Pivoting:

Require ARP spoofing or port forwarding to reach the 10.9.8.0/24 network from 192.168.1.100.

Red Herrings:

Add fake vulnerabilities (e.g., an outdated WordPress plugin) to test players' focus.

Log Analysis:

Include a bonus task to cover tracks (e.g., clear logs in /var/log/tomcat9/).
