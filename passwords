Mike,

Iâ€™ve finished the betaâ€”YAHHH! ðŸš€ Everythingâ€™s been moved to our secure and blazing-fast game server for closed playtesting. And because youâ€™re the best boss ever, I made sure you get first dibs!

I set up a special account just for you:
Username: magicalmike
Password: amazingboss123!

Jump in whenever youâ€™re readyâ€”itâ€™s time to unleash your inner tester! Let me know if you hit any snags (but I doubt you will ðŸ˜‰).

Michelle
Head of Development, Rito Games
